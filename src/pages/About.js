        The origins of the word "cocktail" have been debated . The first written
        mention of "cocktail" as a beverage appeared in The Farmers Cabinet,
        1803 in the United States. The first definition of a cocktail as an
        alcoholic beverage appeared three years later in The Balance and
        Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806. Traditionally,
        cocktail ingredients included spirits, sugar, water and bitters,
        however, this definition evolved throughout the 1800s, to include the
        addition of a liqueur. In 1862 Jerry Thomas published a bartender's:
        guide called How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion which
        included 10 cocktail recipes using bitters to differentiate from other
        drinks such as punches and cobblers. Cocktails continued to evolve and
        gain popularity throughout the 1900s, with the term eventually expanding
        to cover all mixed drinks. In 1917 the term "cocktail party" was coined
        by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. With wine and beer
        being less available during the Prohibition in the United States
        (1920_1933), liquor-based cocktails became more popular due to
        accessibility, followed by a decline in popularity during the late
        1960s. The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture through
        the style of mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and other novel
        ingredients. In the modern world and the Information Age, cocktail
        recipes are widely shared online on websites. Cocktails and restaurants
        that serve them are frequently covered and reviewed in tourism magazines
        and guides. Some cocktails, such as the Mojito, Manhattan, and Martini
        have become staples in both restaurants and pop culture phenomena.
